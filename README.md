This will be a Todo app and it is borned to practice React and CRUD. The items have a new place in the list, if grabbed and dropped. The user now can create, update (order) and delete. 

I am working on the moving of the items, the update and the storing in the browser. 

Technique:
  - **React**
  - **Bootstrap**
  - **JavaScript**
  - **State Handling**
  - **CRUD App**
  - **CSS**
  - **HTML**
